The client required a game app that displayed four pictures to the user and he/she would have to guess the word related to it. I was in charge of the development of the whole app and further updates. The UI designs were provided by the design team. The app was kept updated with downloadable levels that where stored on an AWS S3 bucket.

One year after, the app reached 400K downloads. It has huge fan base, with non-official websites with tips and cheats. It's one of the most successful apps I have worked on.
